# Magento Category FAQ Module
This module is used to create FAQ specifically for the category pages. There are mainly 2 faq options. FAQ templates and FAQ's.
## FAQ templates
We can create FAQ templates generic for all the category. This will be general FAQ and which can be displayed under all the category. Some template variables can be used
in the FAQ and that will be auto replaced with the dynamic value.

## FAQ category
We can add FAQ specifiaclly for a category. If this added for a category, then the template FAQ's will not be shown.
